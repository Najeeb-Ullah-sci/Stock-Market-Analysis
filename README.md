Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting Using LSTM
This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of stock market trends, specifically using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting future stock prices based on historical data. The goal is to help investors make informed decisions by utilizing machine learning techniques to predict stock price movements.
Key Features:

    Stock Price Prediction: Leverages LSTM models to predict future stock prices based on historical closing prices.
    Data Collection: Utilizes the yfinance API to fetch historical stock data for tech companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.
    Moving Average Analysis: Computes 10, 20, and 50-day moving averages to identify short-term and long-term trends in stock prices.
    Daily Return Analysis: Calculates daily returns for each stock to assess their performance and volatility.
    Visualization: Provides detailed visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to help analyze stock trends, moving averages, daily returns, and correlations.

Technologies Used:

    Python: Programming language for data analysis and model building.
    yfinance: Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
    pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
    NumPy: Numerical operations.
    Matplotlib / Seaborn: Data visualization.
    Keras / TensorFlow: Building the LSTM model for stock price forecasting.
    Scikit-learn: Machine learning tools for preprocessing and evaluation.

Project Workflow:

    Data Collection:
        Stock data for Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) is downloaded for the last year using the yfinance library.

    Data Preprocessing:
        The stock data is cleaned and processed, including calculating Moving Averages (10, 20, and 50 days) and Daily Returns.
        The data is then scaled using the MinMaxScaler for input into the LSTM model.

    LSTM Model Building:
        An LSTM model is built using Keras to predict stock prices based on the historical data. The model is trained on 95% of the data and tested on the remaining 5%.

    Prediction & Evaluation:
        Predictions are made on the test data, and the model’s performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
        A comparison between the predicted and actual stock prices is visualized to assess the model’s accuracy.

    Visualization:
        Stock price trends, moving averages, daily returns, and correlations are visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Sample Visualizations:

    Closing Price Trend: A line plot showing the historical closing prices of the stocks.
    Moving Averages: Visualizes 10, 20, and 50-day moving averages.
    Daily Returns: Histograms and line plots showing daily return percentages for each stock.
    Pairplot: Visual comparison of daily returns across the selected tech stocks.
    Heatmaps: Correlation heatmaps showing the relationship between stock returns and closing prices.

Model Performance:

    Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is calculated to assess the accuracy of the stock price predictions.
    The visual comparison of the predicted vs. actual prices gives a clear view of the model's performance.

Future Improvements:

    Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the LSTM model to improve prediction accuracy.
    Incorporating More Features: Including other factors like market indicators or sentiment analysis for more accurate predictions.
    Longer Time Period: Expanding the dataset to include a longer historical period for more robust forecasting.
